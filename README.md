# Escape-Room

This project is a recreation of the classic hangman game with the addition of a fun twist. Modeled after an escape room, the only way out is by successfully complete the final hangman which will unlock the door. However, beware! Each player will only be granted four lives upon entering the room which means that they may incorrectly guess no more than four letters or words to the hangman. In order to earn more lives, the player must explore the various objects in the room, each of which holds a different puzzle to solve. For each puzzle that is solved successfully, the player will be granted an extra life. Each room will have a creative theme associated with it to add a whimsical lighthearted feel to this game.
